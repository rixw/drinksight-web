# DrinkSight website

This is the github repository for the https://drinksight.com website.

## Why store your website in a public repository?

The website is (currently) a single page. I'll grow it in time, but for now I wanted to demonstrate the technicals that sit behind the site.

## The technology stack

* HTML5
* JavaScript
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) (with server-side rendering)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (scss syntax)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
* [Buefy](https://buefy.org/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Credit where credit is due

The site started out with a quick `create-nuxt-app` [See the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation/).

## Build and run

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
