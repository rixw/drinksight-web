      <p>
        We respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this
        policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us.
        You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of
        unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something
        you might later regret.

      <p>
        We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to
        keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable
        with the information companies, governments, and other organisations
        keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers.
        We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why
        you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re
        forced to by law.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-we-collect-information">How we collect information</h3>
      <p>
        We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and
        phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our website uses Google Analytics to analyse activity on the website. It
        does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, but
        does record your IP address and set
        <a href="/cookies/">cookies</a>
        on your computer. We don’t use native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’
        buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.
      </p>

        <a href="/cookies/">Find out about cookies on our site</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect your email address when you sign up for one of our
        newsletters.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy
        something from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our
        partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give
        it to us directly.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-information-we-hold">What information we hold</h3>
      <p>
        When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your
        name, email address, phone number, a social media username, and the
        company you work for, if you’ve given us that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you buy something from us, we collect your name, email address,
        phone number, and a delivery address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank
        details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments
        you make.
      </p>
      <h3 id="where-we-store-your-information">
        Where we store your information
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you contact us by through our website, we store your your
        information in Netlify Forms, our web host’s form processing service,
        and in Google Mail. If we do business, we store your information in our
        accounts software, Xero. We chose these systems partly for their
        commitment to security.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-we-use-your-information-for">
        What we use your information for
      </h3>
      <p>
        We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our
        products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe
        from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might
        also email or phone you about our products and services, but if you tell
        us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We will use your information to
        send you invoices, statements, or reminders.
      </p>

        Who’s responsible for your information at our company
      </h3>
      <p>
        Richard Weaver is responsible for the security of your information. You
        can contact them by email at
        <a href="mailto:richard@drinksight.com">richard@drinksight.com</a> or by

      <h3 id="who-has-access-to-information-about-you">
        Who has access to information about you
      </h3>
      <p>
        When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need
        it have access. Our management team have access to everything you’ve
        provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to
        do their job.

        The steps we take to keep your information private
      </h3>
      <p>
        Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict
        access only to people who need it. We store passwords in LastPass, an
        encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password
        for each service, and never use the same password twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The computers we use are all encrypted using Apple FileVault and are
        protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for
        authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of
        inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or
        facial recognition.
      </p>
